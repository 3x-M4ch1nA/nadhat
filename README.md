Welcome to Nadhat.
==================

Nadhat is a GSM/GPRS modem hat for raspberry pi. It's pi zero hat format compatible (30x65mm). It uses the well known SIM800C module to offer a lost M2M communication interface.

You'll find in this deposit datasheets and application notes, some pieces of firmware and more in the future.

Have fun.
